## Are you sick of seeing your screenshots named as Screenshot 2024-11-04 at 1.29.29â€¯PM? 
Name your screenshots using VLMs that run on your device, with the option to choose from Moondream Llava or minicpm-v all run through Ollama on your device (pre-requisite to any of this working for now)

This is a very early first version. You can run it in your terminal by running ```swift Names.swift``` in this directory
